    "abstract": "<jats:p>In nonstructural infill panels, common materials like expanded polystyrene panels face fire susceptibility, autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) incurs high production costs, and traditional bricks come with a significant carbon footprint and weight. So, there is a requirement for infill panels that are not just resilient and lightweight but sustainable as well. This study seeks to address these issues by introducing sustainable and lightweight expanded clay aggregate (ECA) in concrete. Firstly, eight ECA mix designs were prepared by integrating fly ash and kerosene with clay, and ECA with a bulk density of 0.59 g/cm³ and compressive strength of up to 1.73 MPa were prepared. The lightest ECA mix was then chosen to explore their use in lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC) along with fly ash as a secondary cementitious material. The resulting LWAC had a minimum density of 1,050 kg/m³ and a compressive strength of 6.8 MPa, fulfilling the standard requirements of a minimum of 3.5 MPa for nonstructural concrete.</jats:p>",

The data are derived from the author's own research including test series not published before and from more than 400 other test series comprising approximately 3000 specimens known from literature and personal contact. The data cover a variety of concretes with aggregates such as siliceous materials, limestone, granite, sea gravel, pumice, and expanded clay to fire-resistant concrete based on chamotte or Danish mo-clay. Processes are briefly described that are responsible for the deterioration of the materials when they are heated and when they are cooled down after a fire. In addition, it is explained how variations of the concrete composition influences the deterioration. Necessary characteristics of design methods are derived for variable fire courses based on analyses of consequences of material deterioration. The paper serves as a basis for a number of papers presenting calculation methods developed by the author for load-bearing capacity of any structure of any concrete at any time of any fire exposure. Some of these methods and related materials data are adopted in the CEN: ENV 1992-1-2 code and national codes such as the Danish DS411. The present paper serves as a part of the documentation for the methods and it is therefore also a supporting document for these standards. </jats:p>",

The cleaner production is based on saving matter through the valorization of waste available in industry as a substitute of clays into the formulation of the lightweight aggregates (LWAs). Three different types of clays (white, black, and red) and alternative raw materials were blended. Cattle bone flour ash (CBA) and a fertilizer glass (FG) were used to introduce K and P into the mixture in amounts suitable for fertilizer application, and a sewage sludge from a brewery wastewater treatment plant was used as pore forming agent. For the production of the LWAs, we mixed different percentage of waste in two different clay mixtures, which were thermally treated at 1000 °C for 1 h. Technological parameters such as loose bulk and oven dry density, total porosity, water absorption capacity, pH, and electrical conductivity were determined to evaluate the potential use of LWAs as a growing media. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) techniques were used, and leaching tests were performed to complete the samples’ characterization. The results indicated the potential for manufacturing high-quality LWAs for the agronomic field by using energy-saving and matter-processing involving low temperatures with respect to the conventional process.</jats:p>",

Cement manufacturing has increased at an exponential rate, reaching 3 billion metric tons in 2015, representing a 6.3% annual growth rate and accounting for around 5–8% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Geopolymer materials, which are inorganic polymers made from a wide range of aluminosilicate powders, such as metakaolin, fly ash, and blast furnace or steel slags, have also been elicited for use due to concerns about the high energy consumption and CO2 emissions connected with cement and concrete manufacturing. This study focused on the mechanical and durability properties of metakaolin in concrete production. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were used to confirm the characteristics of kaolin and metakaolin. The results showed that 15 wt.% metakaolin can be used to partially replace cement, and that metakaolin, when synthesized with alkaline activators, can also be utilized as a geopolymer to totally replace cement in concrete production. For predicting the compressive strength of different concrete mixtures, few practical models have been presented. This research has shed light on the possibility of utilizing ecologically friendly materials in the building, construction, and transportation sectors to decrease carbon dioxide emissions.</jats:p>",

The usage of AAC has some advantages, but it also has negative environmental impacts since rejected concrete will become landfill. This study aimed to use AAC waste powder as a material that would partially replace the sand content to produce a new form of Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (AAC). The physical and mechanical properties of the newly developed AAC were investigated. This paper presents improved mechanical and physical properties of the new form of recycled AAC concrete. Besides these improvements, using recycled AAC could lower production costs. Furthermore, the usage of this recycled waste powder is both economically and environmentally advantageous. This study found that when recycled AAC was substituted for sand, AAC with a fine recycled powder content of 30% had a compressive strength that was around 16% higher than conventional AAC and between 29% and 156% higher than any value attained utilizing an industrial waste product. This study also confirmed that the greater strength could be identical to a higher tobermorite phase and that the recycled AAC surface showed a finer crystalline morphology.</jats:p>",

The paper proposes the relationships between the compressive strength and density of concrete mixtures with different proportions of the lightweight aggregates mentioned above. The performed experimental studies have revealed the tendencies of possible usage of different amounts of fine lightweight aggregates and their combinations in the production of concrete mixtures depending on the demands of practical application. Following the requirements for structural concrete subjected to environmental effects, durability properties (alkaline corrosion and freeze–thaw resistance) of the selected concrete mixtures with expanded glass aggregate were studied. The results of the experimental investigations have shown that durability of tested concrete specimens was sufficient. The study has concluded that the mixtures under consideration can be applied for the production of structural elements to which durability requirements are significant.</jats:p>",

The bulk density and water absorption ratio of the specimen were measured, and the cross section was observed. No black core was observed under the rapid sintering condition, and it was lightened at an inflection point of 1150 °C. A reduction in the bulk density was observed in a shorter period of time when the input temperature was high under the normal sintering conditions. Regardless of the input temperature, the bulk density change was divided into three sections and a bloating-activation zone was observed in which the density abruptly decreased.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>As the demand for nonrenewable natural resources, such as aggregate, is increasing worldwide, new production of artificial aggregate should be developed. Artificial lightweight aggregate can bring advantages to the construction field due to its lower density, thus reducing the dead load applied to the structural elements. In addition, application of artificial lightweight aggregate in lightweight concrete will produce lower thermal conductivity. However, the production of artificial lightweight aggregate is still limited. Production of artificial lightweight aggregate incorporating waste materials or pozzolanic materials is advantageous and beneficial in terms of being environmentally friendly, as well as lowering carbon dioxide emissions. Moreover, additives, such as geopolymer, have been introduced as one of the alternative construction materials that have been proven to have excellent properties. Thus, this paper will review the production of artificial lightweight aggregate through various methods, including sintering, cold bonding, and autoclaving. The significant properties of artificial lightweight aggregate, including physical and mechanical properties, such as water absorption, crushing strength, and impact value, are reviewed. The properties of concrete, including thermal properties, that utilized artificial lightweight aggregate were also briefly reviewed to highlight the advantages of artificial lightweight aggregate.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, lightweight aggregate concrete is becoming more popular due to its versatile properties. It mainly helps to reduce the dead loads of the structure, which ultimately reduces design load requirements. The main challenge associated with lightweight aggregate concrete is finding an optimized mix per requirements. However, the conventional material design of this composite is quite costly, time-consuming, and iterative. This research proposes a simplified methodology for the mix designing of structural and non-structural lightweight aggregate concrete by incorporating machine learning. For this purpose, five distinct machine learning algorithms, support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree (DT), Gaussian process of regression (GPR), and extreme gradient boosting tree (XGBoost) algorithms, were investigated. For the training, testing, and validation process, a total of 420 data points were collected from 43 published journal articles. The performance of models was evaluated based on statistical performance indicators. Overall, 11 input parameters, including ingredients of the concrete mix and aggregate properties were entertained; the only output parameter was the compressive strength of lightweight concrete. The results revealed that the GPR model outperformed the remaining four machine learning models by attaining an R2 value of 0.99, RMSE of 1.34, MSE of 1.79, and MAE of 0.69. In a nutshell, these simplified modern techniques can be employed to make the design of lightweight aggregate concrete easy without extensive experimentation.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Intraductal papillary neoplasms of the bile duct are generally thought to arise from neoplastic papillary proliferation of epithelial cells lining the bile duct. We herein report a case with findings that strongly suggested that the biliary cystic tumor might have derived from a peribiliary gland. A 69-year-old female was found to have a cystic lesion with intracystic protrusions at the anterior segment of the right hepatic lobe and underwent hepatic anterior segment resection. Fluoroscopy of the resected specimen injected with contrast medium into the cyst revealed a connection between the cystic lesion and the bile ducts. The cyst was multilocular in appearance. On microscopic examination, the cyst was located within the portal tract of the inferior branch of the anterior segment and connected with the inferior branch of the bile duct. The wall of the hepatic cyst lacked an ovarian-like stroma. The tumor was composed of papillary and glandular components, and the tumor cells were similar to gastric foveolar and pyloric gland epithelia and regarded as adenoma. These tumor cells were positive for MUC 5AC, MUC6, and HIK1083. The tumor was finally diagnosed as an intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (adenoma, gastric type) arising from a peribiliary gland.",
