    "abstract": "<jats:p>Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems—patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients—and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This research focused on the obtainment of sustainable lightweight aggregates (LWAs) for agronomic application. The cleaner production is based on saving matter through the valorization of waste available in industry as a substitute of clays into the formulation of the lightweight aggregates (LWAs). Three different types of clays (white, black, and red) and alternative raw materials were blended. Cattle bone flour ash (CBA) and a fertilizer glass (FG) were used to introduce K and P into the mixture in amounts suitable for fertilizer application, and a sewage sludge from a brewery wastewater treatment plant was used as pore forming agent. For the production of the LWAs, we mixed different percentage of waste in two different clay mixtures, which were thermally treated at 1000 °C for 1 h. Technological parameters such as loose bulk and oven dry density, total porosity, water absorption capacity, pH, and electrical conductivity were determined to evaluate the potential use of LWAs as a growing media. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) techniques were used, and leaching tests were performed to complete the samples’ characterization. The results indicated the potential for manufacturing high-quality LWAs for the agronomic field by using energy-saving and matter-processing involving low temperatures with respect to the conventional process.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, lightweight aggregate concrete is becoming more popular due to its versatile properties. It mainly helps to reduce the dead loads of the structure, which ultimately reduces design load requirements. The main challenge associated with lightweight aggregate concrete is finding an optimized mix per requirements. However, the conventional material design of this composite is quite costly, time-consuming, and iterative. This research proposes a simplified methodology for the mix designing of structural and non-structural lightweight aggregate concrete by incorporating machine learning. For this purpose, five distinct machine learning algorithms, support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree (DT), Gaussian process of regression (GPR), and extreme gradient boosting tree (XGBoost) algorithms, were investigated. For the training, testing, and validation process, a total of 420 data points were collected from 43 published journal articles. The performance of models was evaluated based on statistical performance indicators. Overall, 11 input parameters, including ingredients of the concrete mix and aggregate properties were entertained; the only output parameter was the compressive strength of lightweight concrete. The results revealed that the GPR model outperformed the remaining four machine learning models by attaining an R2 value of 0.99, RMSE of 1.34, MSE of 1.79, and MAE of 0.69. In a nutshell, these simplified modern techniques can be employed to make the design of lightweight aggregate concrete easy without extensive experimentation.</jats:p>",
