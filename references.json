    "abstract": "<jats:p>This research focused on the obtainment of sustainable lightweight aggregates (LWAs) for agronomic application. The cleaner production is based on saving matter through the valorization of waste available in industry as a substitute of clays into the formulation of the lightweight aggregates (LWAs). Three different types of clays (white, black, and red) and alternative raw materials were blended. Cattle bone flour ash (CBA) and a fertilizer glass (FG) were used to introduce K and P into the mixture in amounts suitable for fertilizer application, and a sewage sludge from a brewery wastewater treatment plant was used as pore forming agent. For the production of the LWAs, we mixed different percentage of waste in two different clay mixtures, which were thermally treated at 1000 °C for 1 h. Technological parameters such as loose bulk and oven dry density, total porosity, water absorption capacity, pH, and electrical conductivity were determined to evaluate the potential use of LWAs as a growing media. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) techniques were used, and leaching tests were performed to complete the samples’ characterization. The results indicated the potential for manufacturing high-quality LWAs for the agronomic field by using energy-saving and matter-processing involving low temperatures with respect to the conventional process.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, lightweight aggregate concrete is becoming more popular due to its versatile properties. It mainly helps to reduce the dead loads of the structure, which ultimately reduces design load requirements. The main challenge associated with lightweight aggregate concrete is finding an optimized mix per requirements. However, the conventional material design of this composite is quite costly, time-consuming, and iterative. This research proposes a simplified methodology for the mix designing of structural and non-structural lightweight aggregate concrete by incorporating machine learning. For this purpose, five distinct machine learning algorithms, support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree (DT), Gaussian process of regression (GPR), and extreme gradient boosting tree (XGBoost) algorithms, were investigated. For the training, testing, and validation process, a total of 420 data points were collected from 43 published journal articles. The performance of models was evaluated based on statistical performance indicators. Overall, 11 input parameters, including ingredients of the concrete mix and aggregate properties were entertained; the only output parameter was the compressive strength of lightweight concrete. The results revealed that the GPR model outperformed the remaining four machine learning models by attaining an R2 value of 0.99, RMSE of 1.34, MSE of 1.79, and MAE of 0.69. In a nutshell, these simplified modern techniques can be employed to make the design of lightweight aggregate concrete easy without extensive experimentation.</jats:p>",
