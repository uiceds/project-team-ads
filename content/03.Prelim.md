## 4. Preliminary Predictive Modeling {.page_break_before}

<p align="justify">
Before initiating machine learning model training, hyperparameter optimization is performed through iterative refinement to achieve maximal predictive accuracy. The specification of model parameters varies across distinct models and datasets. A systematic exploration of key architectural and training parameters including the number of hidden layers, learning rate, ensemble size, leaf size, and data partitioning for training, validation, and testing was conducted to determine optimal configurations. Given the vast parameter space, a focused approach was employed, selectively tuning critical hyperparameters while maintaining default settings for others. The optimized hyperparameter configurations for the machine learning models are presented in [Table 5](#Table 5).

### 4.1. Results and Discussions

<p align="justify">
Several machine learning methods were trained for the task, and it turned out that the Artificial neural network (ANN) gave the best result for density, the Gaussian process of regression (GPR) for compressive strength, and Random Forest for tensile strength. The model's accuracy is measured in terms of R2; the larger the value, the more accurate the model will be. In the case of the RMSE, the lower the value, the greater the accuracy of the model. [Figure 10](fig:Fig.10), [Figure 11](fig:Fig.11), and [Figure 12](fig:Fig.12) compare the actual and predicted results of the output parameters for all three models. Also, the statistical parameters indicators considered for the task have been compiled in [Table 6](#Table 6) for reference.

### 4.2. Explainable AI

<p align="justify">
To justify the model results explainable AI was used to extract logical conclusions from the results. This was done using model agnostic techniques such as Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) and SHAP (Shapley Additive explanations) to reveal insights like monotonic relationships, non-linear interactions, plateaus, and feature importance. 

SHAP is a model-agnostic technique that explains individual predictions by assigning values to features based on their contribution. It utilizes Shapley values to measure feature contributions and additive models to combine them. SHAP works by perturbing input features, calculating predictions, and assigning Shapley values. The values are interpreted as positive (contributing positively), negative (contributing negatively), or magnitude (representing contribution strength). SHAP scatter plots specifically reveal feature contributions, relationships, and correlations, offering accurate attribution, model-agnostic compatibility, and enhanced interpretability. The Shapley value scatter plot illustrates the impact of different input features on the model's output. Features positioned to the right of the vertical line positively influence the output, while those on the left negatively impact it. The distance of a feature from the line indicates its relative importance. For instance, in [Figure 13](fig:Fig.13) (b) below "Cement Quantity" has a strong positive influence, while "Super-plasticizer" has a strong negative one. Similarly, the Shapley value bar graph indicates which input parameter affects the output parameter the most. It is evident from [Figure 13](fig:Fig.13) and [Figure 14](fig:Fig.14) that W/B ratio, LWA density, and LWA quantity are the controlling parameters for the tensile and compression strength of lightweight concrete. It has been established in the literature that an increase in the water/cement ratio affects the strength and an increase of 0.2 of the W/B ratio decreases the strength by 5% and increases the porosity by 5%. An increase in porosity causes a reduction in strength [@doi:10.3390/atmos13091494]. Additionally in lightweight concreteâ€™s mix design, the failure is not controlled by the matrix but by the lightweight aggregate. Therefore, the quality and quantity of lightweight aggregate play a huge role. However, factors i.e., flyash quantity and superplasticizers impact rheology and durability but not the mechanical properties of concrete [@doi:10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2022.128187]. On the other hand, density is solely controlled by lightweight aggregate weight and quantity since aggregate makes upto 70% of the concrete mass [@22126388].

<p align="justify">
PDPs visualize the relationship between input features and predicted outcomes, helping understand how changes in individual features affect model predictions. They divide the feature range into discrete intervals, calculate predictions, average across data points, and plot results. Hence the results of the PDPs were evaluated and compared with the established understandings of concrete science. In concrete science, we know that the input parameters for Lightweight Concrete (LWC) significantly impact its properties. Cement, normal-weight aggregate, and fly ash positively influence compressive and split tensile strength, while sand and LWA quantity negatively affect strength due to increased porosity [@Qasrawi2000]. W/B ratio and curing time also impact strength development [@Kim2004]. LWA density and super-plasticizer improve strength and workability, whereas LWA water absorption decreases strength [@KmieciK2011]. Fly ash reduces density. Normal weight aggregate increases density and strength [@doi:10.1016/j.cemconres.2010.11.003]. All the PDPs showed similar trends which concrete scientists report throughout, and no anomalous behavior was seen which reassured the explainability of the models that the models have learned in the same way the concrete behaves. However, no concrete science was fed to the model except for the 10 input parameters. The PDPs of the three selected models can be seen in [Figure 16](fig:Fig.16), [Figure 17](fig:Fig.17) and [Figure 18](fig:Fig.18) below.

## 5. Results and Discussion {.page_break_before}

<p align="justify">
A comprehensive study was conducted to develop a machine learning-based approach for automating the mix design of lightweight aggregate concrete. The primary objective was to predict specific mechanical properties i.e., compressive strength tensile strength, and density of lightweight concrete using multiple machine-learning models. The complexity of the mix design in lightweight aggregate concrete arises from the diverse properties of its constituents, posing a long-standing challenge to the concrete industry. To address this, a data-driven approach was employed, commencing with the compilation of data from credible, peer-reviewed literature. The collected data underwent rigorous cleaning, involving the removal of outliers and the exclusion of data from questionable sources. Following data normalization, multiple machine-learning models were trained for each mechanical property, with only the top-performing models reported for each output variable.
The Random Forest model demonstrated the highest accuracy for Split tensile strength, achieving a low RMSE of 1.0654 and a high R-squared of 0.94. Gaussian Process Regression provided satisfactory results for Compression Strength, with an RMSE of 12.409 and an R-squared of 0.9. The Artificial Neural Network struggled to predict Density, showing the highest RMSE of 295.34 and the lowest R-squared of 0.91. While the Neural Network had the fastest prediction speed of ~24000 obs/sec, it also required the largest model size of ~37 kB. It is evident from the results of the explanation using explainable AI that W/B ratio, LWA density, and LWA quantity are the controlling parameters for the tensile and compression strength of lightweight concrete. On the other hand, density is solely controlled by lightweight aggregate weight and quantity since aggregate makes up 70% of the concrete mass. The relationship between each input parameter to a specific output parameter also showed similar trends with the existing literature on concrete science. 
Therefore, the hypothesis of predicting certain mechanical properties of concrete from a data-driven approach certainly became successful, with the models showing high accuracies. Additionally, XAI enabled us to identify the key controlling parameters of each output parameter, and these findings also corresponded to the theories established by the scientists who studied the materials science of concrete for a long time. 
The accuracy of the trained models can be used for further uses for the development of an AI-based application or tool. The existing error in the models comes from the fact that the data has been collected from over 100 papers. This means that hundreds of people have been involved in data collection and concrete casting, and every individual brings along a certain amount of error with him. This error or bias can be reduced by the development of the data set from a single laboratory and completely controlling the dataset. Another problem could be that models developed for small-scale experiments may not generalize well to larger-scale applications.
The probable next step for the authors is the development of a user-friendly graphical user interface (see [Figure 19](fig:Fig.19)) that will take the input parameters as input and give the compressive strength tensile strength, and density of lightweight concrete as output. Now if a new lightweight aggregate is proposed, a new foaming admixture is proposed, or a new curing approach is proposed, the composition of the proposed mux can be put into the app or graphical user interface which will give highly accurate predictions for its future mechanical performance. Additionally, this app will predict in seconds, on the other hand it takes months to collect real-life field data.
