## 4. Preliminary Predictive Modeling {.page_break_before}

<p align="justify">
Before initiating machine learning model training, hyperparameter optimization is performed through iterative refinement to achieve maximal predictive accuracy. The specification of model parameters varies across distinct models and datasets. A systematic exploration of key architectural and training parameters including the number of hidden layers, learning rate, ensemble size, leaf size, and data partitioning for training, validation, and testing was conducted to determine optimal configurations. Given the vast parameter space, a focused approach was employed, selectively tuning critical hyperparameters while maintaining default settings for others. The optimized hyperparameter configurations for the machine learning models are presented in [Table 5](#Table 5).

### 4.1. Results and Discussions

<p align="justify">
Several machine learning methods were trained for the task, and it turned out that the Artificial neural network (ANN) gave the best result for density, the Gaussian process of regression (GPR) for compressive strength, and Random Forest for tensile strength. The model's accuracy is measured in terms of R2; the larger the value, the more accurate the model will be. In the case of the RMSE, the lower the value, the greater the accuracy of the model. Fig. X, Y, and Z compare the actual and predicted results of the output parameters for all three models. Also, the statistical parameters indicators considered for the task have been compiled in [Table 6](#Table 6) for reference.
